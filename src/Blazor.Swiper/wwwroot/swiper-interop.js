//
// Beyond forwarding calls, this module closes gaps that every host would otherwise have to work around
// itself: telling a user's swipe apart from a code-driven move, keeping autoHeight true after init,
// making programmatic navigation work in cssMode, and keeping Swiper's own re-anchors from undoing a
// move that is already in flight. Per-instance state lives on `element.__blazorSwiper`, which is on the
// element rather than on the Swiper instance so it survives a destroy.
//
// The decisions behind those behaviours live in swiper-policy.js, which touches neither Swiper nor
// the DOM and is covered by tests/interop/swiper-policy.test.mjs. This file is the wiring.
